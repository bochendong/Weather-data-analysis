### Weather-data-analysis
This project will analyze and visualize the meteorological data of the northern coast of Italy. During the experiment, we will first use the matplotlib library in Python to graph the data, and then call the SVM library in the scikit-learn library to perform regression analysis on the data, and finally draw our conclusions with the support of graph analysis.

## Research System: Adriatic Sea and Po River Basin
The area of the Po River Basin in Italy is very suitable for studying the impact of the ocean on the climate. This plain stretches from the Adriatic Sea to the east for hundreds of kilometers inland (see Figure below). Although it is surrounded by mountains, its wide area weakens the influence of the mountains. In addition, the area is densely populated with cities and towns, and it is also convenient to select a group of cities with different distances from the sea. In the selected cities, the maximum distance between the two cities is about 400 kilometers.
